Q.1. What is the difference between the static and the non-static variables of a class explain it with an example?

Ans. 

Static Variables:-
1.Static variables are shared among all instances of a class.
2.Static variable is like a global variable and is available    to all methods.
3.Static variables can be accessed by static and non static methods.
4.Static variables can be accessed using class name.
5.Static variables reduce the amount of memory used by a program.

Non-Static Variables:-
1.Non static variables are specific to that instance of a class.
2.Non static variable is like a local variable and they can be accessed through only instance of a class.
3.Non static variables cannot be accessed inside a static method.
4.Non static variables can be accessed using instance of a class.
5.Non static variables do not reduce the amount of memory used by a program.


E.g..

class Demo {

	int x = 10;
	
	public static void main(String[] args){

	int y = 20;

	System.out.println(y); // y can be printed directly

	Demo d1 = new Demo(); //object to access non static variable

	d1.x = 30;

	System.out.println(d1.x); 

	}

}

Output:-

20
30
